# Firebase SDK: Handling Transient Network Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Firebase applications: inadequate handling of transient network errors during critical operations.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of how an interrupted network connection can lead to unexpected behavior.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution using retry mechanisms and improved error handling.

**Problem:**  The Firebase SDK may not always provide sufficient error handling for transient network disruptions.  This can lead to crashes, data inconsistencies, or unexpected application behavior.

**Solution:** Implement robust error handling and retry logic to gracefully manage temporary network issues.  This involves using appropriate error detection and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff to prevent overwhelming the Firebase servers while ensuring eventual success.
