The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the user's network connection is interrupted during a critical operation, such as writing data to the database or authenticating a user. This is particularly problematic because the error handling in the SDK might not always be sufficient to handle these transient network issues gracefully.  The application might crash or enter an inconsistent state without clear indication of the root cause.
